          During his 8 years he has played a lot, walked a lot, barked, jumped, stolen food items (and non-food items), but most of all he has brought smiles to a lot of people's faces!

        <h3 id="headline">So many adventures:</h3>
        <li>Born in Cachoeirinha, a small city in southern Brazil;</li>
        <li>A few months after birth, flew to Rio de Janeiro to meet his new human parents, Agata e Fabr&iacute;cio;</li>
        <li>Made a lot of new friends at home while waiting for his first vaccinations before he could go for a stroll;</li>
        <li>Finally could go outside, but as a proper Basset Hound, always refused to walk too much and just sat by the curb after a few steps;</li>
        <li>Loved the pub near his house, where he would sit and charm the drunken men to pet him;</li>
        <li>Went to the beach many times (Ipanema, Copabana, Barra). He loves the beach, but there's no way he would go close to the water;</li>
        <li>His favorite hobby is travelling by car. He just sits there and sleeps, knowing his humans are less than a meter away;</li>
        <li>Made a few trips to Porto Alegre, close to his hometown, a few times. It's a trip of about 1,000 miles;</li>
        <li>Moved to Porto Alegre in 2015, where he currently lives;</li>
        <li>This year he lost his good friend Nana, a lovely Beagle, to cancer. He couldn't get more sad;</li>
        <li>In a few months he will embark in his biggest adventure. He is going to Poland with his humans to enjoy the wonders of the winter in the northern hemisfere. And a few <em>pierogi</em> too, hopefully!</li>
      </ul>
